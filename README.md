Netflix Clone
Overview
This project is a simple clone of the Netflix landing page, created using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project was to enhance my front-end development skills by replicating a popular web design. The clone mimics the visual layout and design elements of Netflix's homepage.

Features

Custom Styling: The project uses custom CSS to replicate the aesthetics of the Netflix homepage, including sections like the header, navigation bar, movie listings, and footer.
Grid and Flexbox Layouts: Utilized CSS Grid and Flexbox to create an organized and adaptable layout for displaying content.
Hover Effects: Implemented interactive hover effects on movie thumbnails to enhance the user experience.
Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the structure and content of the web page.
CSS3: Handles the styling, layout, and responsive design.
